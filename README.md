# Quiz Game (using Python & Tkinter)
An interactive, GUI-based quiz game built with Python using the Tkinter GUI toolkit and Pillow for image processing. The game presents True/False trivia questions and tracks the user's score. This project was built as part of my Python development coursework to demonstrate object-oriented programming, event-driven GUI design, and data-driven functionality.

## 💡 Features

- GUI built with **Tkinter** and styled for clarity
- Displays trivia questions dynamically
- Accepts **True/False** answers via custom image buttons
- Tracks and displays score in real-time
- Automatically shows final score at the end
- Modular design with separate files for logic, data, and UI

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **Pillow** (image handling)
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Custom class modules** (`QuizBrain`, `Question`, `data.py`)

<!-- ## 🚀 What I Learned / Practiced

- Building GUI applications with **Tkinter**
- Structuring Python programs using **OOP principles**
- Using external data to populate the app dynamically
- Implementing basic game logic and event handling
- Creating reusable code modules for maintainability -->
